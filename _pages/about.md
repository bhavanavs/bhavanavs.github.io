I am interested in the fields of Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, and Operating Systems. I am pursuing my PhD, advised by <a href="https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~sn624/">Prof. Srinivas Narayana</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~badri/">Prof. Badri Nath</a>, in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University. My current work focuses on developing techniques to accurately measure client-visible application response latency from a middle box, such as a load balancer. Additionally, I explore how middleboxes can use these measurements to enhance feedback control, thereby improving the overall performance of distributed systems. A significant aspect of my work is implemented in the eBPF framework, as it offers inherent security and observability across various layers of the stack.
 
Also, I am involved in developing online streaming algorithms for network applications, including intrusion detection systems and load balancers deployed in middleboxes. I am also collaborating with <a href="https://www.openu.ac.il/personal_sites/shir-landau-feibish/">Prof. Shir Landau Feibish</a> and Jonathan Diamant from the University of Haifa on an ongoing research project to identify the heaviest intervals within a given data stream.

Previously, I gained experience working with Citrix Systems in Bangalore, India, and I completed my M. Tech. Degree at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/pkdas/">Prof. Pradip K. Das</a>. I did my B. Tech from Marian Engineering College, Kerala.
