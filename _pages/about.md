I am interested in the fields of Computer Networks, Distributed Systems and Operating Systems. I am doing my PhD advised by <a class="nav-link" href="https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~sn624/">Prof. Srinivas Narayana</a> and Prof. Badri Nath in the Computer Science Department of Rutgers University. My current work is focused on building a distributed load balancer which acts on measurements available on load balancer especially when load balancer has the visibility of ongoing client traffic alone.

Previously I worked with Citrix Systems, Bangalore India. I did my Mtech. from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati under Prof. Pradip K. Das.
