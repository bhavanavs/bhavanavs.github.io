I am interested in the fields of Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, and Operating Systems. I am pursuing my PhD, advised by <a href="https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~sn624/">Prof. Srinivas Narayana</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~badri/">Prof. Badri Nath</a>, in the Computer Science Department at Rutgers University. My current work focuses on developing techniques to measure client-visible application response latency from a middle box, such as a load balancer. I also study the applications of these measurements for improved feedback control on the middle boxes, aiming to enhance the performance of the distributed system. I am also interested in developing streaming algorithms for network applications like intrusion detection systems and load balancers. 

Previously, I worked with Citrix Systems, Bangalore, India. I did my M. Tech. from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati under Prof. Pradip K. Das.
